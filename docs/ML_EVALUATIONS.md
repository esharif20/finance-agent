# Evaluations

Status: draft for review.

## Rules

1. Every intelligence ticket writes its evaluation first: dataset, metric, baseline to beat.
2. Synthetic evaluations run in CI and block merges on regression.
3. Real-data evaluations run only on the Mac; metrics are displayed, never committed.
4. Results are reproducible: fixed seeds, versioned datasets, model and prompt versions recorded. Synthetic results are committed to `evals/results/`.
5. New model versions run in shadow and are promoted only when they beat the live version.

## Financial correctness (property tests, Hypothesis)

| Invariant | Test |
| --- | --- |
| Re-importing a file changes nothing | import twice, Ledger identical |
| Overlapping exports never duplicate | random overlapping windows of one synthetic history |
| Ledger reconciles with bank balances | sum of Transactions = balance change, or a Reconciliation Gap is recorded |
| Money is exact | all amounts `Decimal`/minor units; no float anywhere in `ledger` (lint rule) |
| Transfers net to zero | linked Transfer pairs sum to zero across Accounts |
| Refunds count when received | ADR 0004 cases |
| Pending never counts | totals unchanged by pending rows |
| Allocation Plans are feasible | plan totals equal income; every hard constraint satisfied |

## ML quality

| Component | Metric | Baseline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Categorisation | macro F1, per-Category precision and recall, expected calibration error | Corrections + rules only |
| Unknown-category detection | AUROC on held-out Categories | max-probability threshold |
| New-category proposals | precision of proposals the user accepts | none (track) |
| Merchant normalisation | exact-match accuracy on synthetic descriptors | lower-case + strip digits |
| Recurring detection | precision and recall on synthetic schedules | same amount ± 5%, same interval |
| Forecasting | MASE, prediction-interval coverage | seasonal naive |
| Preference prediction | log loss and calibration on accept/dismiss | global acceptance rate |
| Recommendation ranking | offline replay: acceptance of top 3 | rank by £ impact |
| Change-point detection | detection delay and false alarms on synthetic shifts | none |

## Assistant quality

Golden set of ~100 synthetic questions with expected intent, tool calls and figures; it doubles as the model benchmark.

| Metric | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Tool selection accuracy | high; compared across models |
| Argument validity | high |
| Grounding pass rate | 100% |
| Correct refusals | high |
| Injection suite pass rate | high (malicious descriptors, CSV cells, chat) |
| Memory correctness | Proposals only when supported by the conversation |
| Explanation quality | local LLM judge with fixed rubric; cloud judge on synthetic data; human spot-check |
| Latency and peak memory on M1 Pro 16 GB | recorded per model |

## Outcomes over time

The "How well I know you" page tracks: categorisation accuracy on recent Corrections, forecast error, preference calibration, Insight acceptance rate, outcomes of accepted recommendations, and monthly cloud spend.
